# React + Aleo

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/AleoHQ/sdk/tree/testnet3/create-aleo-app/template-react)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React and Aleo working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Note: Webpack is currently used for production builds due to a [bug](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13367) with Vite related to nested workers.
